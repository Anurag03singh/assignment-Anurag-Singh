# Frontend Developer Assignment - SolveEase

This assignment demonstrates practical skills in React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and frontend optimizations through a worker listing application.

## Assignment Overview

The project involved working on an existing Next.js application to identify and resolve layout/design issues, configuration bugs, and implement requested features to enhance user experience.

## Implemented Tasks

### 1. Fix Cards Layout & Responsiveness
- **Status**: Completed
- **Changes**: 
  - Corrected existing card grid layout with responsive breakpoints
  - Improved overall card design with modern UI/UX principles
  - Implemented responsive grid: 1 column (mobile), 2 columns (tablet), 3 columns (desktop)
  - Enhanced card styling with rounded corners, subtle shadows, and hover effects
  - Added consistent aspect ratio (4:3) for all card images
  - Optimized typography with proper hierarchy and spacing

### 2. Add Navbar (Sticky)
- **Status**: Completed
- **Changes**:
  - Implemented sticky navigation bar that remains fixed at top while scrolling
  - Clean, responsive design with backdrop blur effect
  - Added navigation links: Workers, Filters, GitHub
  - Included footer with copyright information
  - Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

### 3. Optimize Page Load & Performance
- **Status**: Completed
- **Changes**:
  - Implemented lazy loading for images with proper `loading="lazy"` attribute
  - Added memoization using `useMemo` for filtered results, services list, and paginated data
  - Created skeleton loading screens for better UX during data fetch
  - Optimized image loading with proper `sizes` attribute for responsive images
  - Implemented browser caching via `fetch` with `cache: 'force-cache'`
  - Added `unoptimized` flag for external images to prevent optimization issues

### 4. Implement Pagination
- **Status**: Completed
- **Changes**:
  - Added pagination for workers listing with 9 items per page
  - Implemented Gmail-style pagination with "start-end of total" counter
  - Added previous/next navigation with chevron buttons
  - Pagination resets to page 1 when filters change
  - Responsive pagination controls with proper spacing
  - Disabled states for navigation buttons at boundaries

### 5. Service Filters
- **Status**: Completed
- **Changes**:
  - Implemented filters for workers based on price/day range
  - Added service type filter dropdown with dynamic options
  - Filters work seamlessly with pagination (resets to page 1)
  - Real-time filtering with instant UI updates
  - Responsive filter layout with proper form controls
  - Integrated with existing data structure

### 6. Bug Fixes
- **Status**: Completed
- **Changes**:
  - Fixed duplicate data loading in `useEffect`
  - Resolved Next.js images configuration deprecation warning
  - Removed unused imports (`Suspense`)
  - Fixed horizontal scrolling by adding `overflow-x-hidden` to body
  - Cleaned up code structure and removed redundant logic
  - Ensured proper TypeScript types and error handling
  - Fixed image loading issues in production environment

### 7. API Integration
- **Status**: Completed
- **Changes**:
  - Created `/api/workers` endpoint serving data from `workers.json`
  - Updated frontend to fetch data using `fetch` API with proper error handling
  - Commented out existing local import logic (preserved as requested)
  - Implemented loading states with skeleton screens
  - Added error handling with friendly error messages
  - Implemented basic caching to prevent redundant API calls
  - Added proper TypeScript interfaces for API responses

## Technical Implementation

### Configuration Fixes
- Updated `next.config.ts` to use `images.remotePatterns` instead of deprecated `images.domains`
- Added support for `randomuser.me` and `images.unsplash.com` domains
- Configured proper image optimization settings for external URLs

### Performance Optimizations
- Memoized expensive computations (filtering, pagination)
- Implemented lazy loading for images
- Added browser-side caching for API responses
- Optimized re-renders with proper dependency arrays

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS breakpoints
- Flexible grid layouts that adapt to screen sizes
- Responsive typography and spacing
- Touch-friendly interactive elements

### Code Quality
- TypeScript for type safety
- Clean, readable component structure
- Proper error boundaries and loading states
- Consistent naming conventions
- Component-driven development principles
